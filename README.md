# The 7th Saga Randomizer
This randomizer changes the way The 7th Saga is played in numerous ways.  It also finds ways to speed up the game to prevent massive amounts of grinding that this game is notorious for.

# Optional changes the way the game is played

- Randomize monster zones (meaning you can run into something completely different at a location)
- Randomize monster patterns (Hermits casting Vacuum2, anyone?!)
- Randomize hero spells (anybody has the chance to learn Elixer now)
- Randomize treasures (all treasures are completely randomized except the key items)
- Randomize stores
- Randomize who can equip a weapon or a piece of armor
- Double walking speed, which usually decreases the number of encounters you run into.
- Text/Quality Of Life speed hacks.  These speeds up the intro and the shopping experience for the most part.
- Boost XP/GP up to 7x of normal.
- Randomize gold price requirements up to 14-700% of normal.
- Randomize hero stats up to 14-700% of normal.  If this is anything other than 100%, the stats will be normalized between all characters so they all start at the same value.
- Randomize monster stats up to 14-700% of normal.  This means certain monsters can totally wipe out a tank if they roll right.
- Randomize equipment powers up to 14-700% of normal, making some weapons incredibly strong.
- Randomize spell powers and costs up to 14-700% of normal.  This means that FIRE 1 can be super strong... and super expensive!
- Remove "useless triggers", including not needing to get the map to get Brantu in Zellis and not having to continuously talk to the Guntz Sage so you can get Digger Quose.  (In other words, you can pick up Quose immediately)
